    <h2>Contract Breakdown</h2>
    <div class="contract-breakdown">
        <p>On December 16th, 2019, Cole recieved one of the largest contracts in baseball at the time. With a guaranteed $324 million dollars, and a signing bonus of $36 million, Cole remains one of the highest paid players in MLB history.</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 9 years</p>
        <p><strong>Total Value:</strong> $324 million</p>
        <p><strong>Annual Average Value:</strong> $36 million</p>
        <p><strong>Signing Bonus:</strong> $36 million</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Financial Analysis</h2>
    <p>Signing stars to large contracts comes with financial risks, no matter the player. Cole has proven to show success after recieving his large contract.</p>
    <p><strong>Revenue Impact:</strong> Gerrit Cole's contract significantly impacted the Yankees' overall revenue streams by increasing ticket sales, merchandising, and media rights benefiting from his presence on the roster.</p>
    <p><strong>Return on Investment (ROI):</strong> The Yankees have seen a high ROI, as Cole's pitching performance and star appeal drive fan engagement, enhance brand value, and contribute to playoff contention.</p>
    <p><strong>Sponsorships and Partnerships:</strong> As one of the top pitchers in the league, Cole's contract also boosts the Yankees' profile, leading to lucrative sponsorship deals and media partnerships.</p>

    <h2>Market Impact</h2>
    <p>The Yankees have a reputation for signing who they need to in order to win. After losing an iconic pitcher, CC Sabathia, to retirement, the Yankees knew they needed a new ace on the mound. Cole, a lifelong Yankee fan and a decorated pitcher, was the perfect fit.</p>
    <p><strong>Brand Value:</strong> Signing Gerrit Cole solidifies the Yankees' reputation as a dominant MLB franchise, boosting merchandise sales and increasing the team's global brand value.</p>
    <p><strong>Competitive Edge:</strong> Cole’s acquisition strengthens the Yankees' pitching rotation, giving them a significant edge in the AL East and playoff races. His leadership and performances on the mound elevate the entire team's competitiveness.</p>
    <p><strong>Fan Engagement:</strong> With Cole anchoring the rotation, the Yankees are expected to experience stronger fan engagement, both in terms of attendance and television viewership, leading to increased ticket and merchandise sales.</p>

    <h2>Strategic Importance</h2>
    <p>Signing star players with no plan doesn't provide value. Thankfull the Yankees knew what they wanted to do with Cole. After signing the then 29 year old, the Yankees knew he was destined to be their ace on the mound and at practice. Signing a star who has been suceeding for years also provides younger players with a role model to help perfect their work.</p>
    <p><strong>Team Performance:</strong> Gerrit Cole’s impact on the mound is crucial to the Yankees’ success. His elite pitching performance helps secure wins and enhances the team’s overall ability to compete at the highest levels.</p>
    <p><strong>Long-term Planning:</strong> This contract exemplifies the Yankees’ commitment to a long-term championship window, positioning Cole as a cornerstone player around whom the team can build for years to come.</p>

    <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
    <p>All players are prone to injury, which is what is heavily considered when talking contracts. Luckily for Cole, he only had one IL stint in his career at the time of his signing. </p>
    <p><strong>Injury Risks:</strong> As with any long-term contract for a pitcher, injury risks remain. The Yankees will need to manage Cole's workload to avoid injuries that could diminish his effectiveness or career longevity.</p>
    <p><strong>Market Fluctuations:</strong> Economic downturns or changes in the sports media landscape could affect the financial projections for Cole's contract, but his marketability and the Yankees' global appeal mitigate much of this risk.</p>
